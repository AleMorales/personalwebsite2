abstract = "Due to their slow movement and closure upon shade, partially closed stomata can be a substantial limitation to photosynthesis in variable light intensities. The abscisic acid deficient *flacca* mutant in tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*) displays very high stomatal conductance (gs). We aimed to determine to what extent this substantially increased gs affects the rate of photosynthetic induction. Steady-state and dynamic photosynthesis characteristics were measured in *flacca* and wildtype leaves, by the use of simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorometry. The steady-state response of photosynthesis to CO2, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry (Fv/Fm), as well as mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion were not significantly different between genotypes, suggesting similar photosynthetic biochemistry, photoprotective capacity, and internal CO2 permeability. When leaves adapted to shade (50 µmol m−2 s−1) at 400 µbar CO2 partial pressure and high humidity (7 mbar leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit, VPD) were exposed to high irradiance (1500 µmol m−2 s−1), photosynthetic induction was faster in *flacca* compared to wildtype leaves, and this was attributable to high initial gs in *flacca* (~0.6 mol m−2 s−1): in *flacca*, the times to reach 50 (t50) and 90% (t90) of full photosynthetic induction were 91 and 46% of wildtype values, respectively. Low humidity (15 mbar VPD) reduced gs and slowed down photosynthetic induction in the wildtype, while no change was observed in *flacca*; under low humidity, t50 was 63% and t90 was 36% of wildtype levels in *flacca*. Photosynthetic induction in low CO2 partial pressure (200 µbar) increased gs in the wildtype (but not in *flacca*), and revealed no differences in the rate of photosynthetic induction between genotypes. Effects of higher gs in *flacca* were also visible in transients of photosystem II operating efficiency and non-photochemical quenching. Our results show that at ambient CO2 partial pressure, wildtype gs is a substantial limitation to the rate of photosynthetic induction, which *flacca* overcomes by keeping its stomata open at all times, and it does so at the cost of reduced water use efficiency."
