I am a postdoctoral researcher at the universities of Wageningen and Utrecht. My skills include model-based statistical inference (both frequentist and Bayesian), scientific programming and process-based modelling as applied in Plant Sciences. My modelling work has focuses on crop modelling and the systems biology of photosynthesis. I am an experienced R and Julia programmer, with some knowledge of C++, with which I have built several [libraries](https://github.com/alemorales).
