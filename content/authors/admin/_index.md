I am a Docent at the [Centre for Crop Systems Analysis](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Centre-for-Crop-Systems-Analysis.htm) at [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm), specialized on Quantitative Crop Ecology, that is, the application of mathematical, statistical and computational models to understand the relationship between crops and their biotic and abiotic environment. My focus is on teaching and the development of software and quantitative methodologies for research. I am an experienced R and Julia programmer, with some knowledge of C++, with which I have built several [libraries](https://github.com/AleMorales).
